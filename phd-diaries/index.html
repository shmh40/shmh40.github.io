            <!-- [comment]: # ( *Friday 17th Feb. Cambridge.* Took train to Cambridge arriving at 9am. Sunny again! Last supervision prep then supervising students from 10am to 12.15pm. Ate a bleak lunch while walking to West Cambridge, but improved by small purple flowers (?) on Queen's Road! Arrived West Cambridge at 12.45pm then delivered workshop to students until 5.10pm. Not my best teaching, but some seemed interested! Dinner with some of the students plus friend then back on train to London arriving home just before 10pm.   *Thursday 16th Feb.* Arrived at work at 7.45am to supervise a student. Marked student work until 10.30am ready for Friday supervision. Read papers from 10.30am to 11.40am before going out to lunch with a friend. Cloudy and drizzly walk. Back at 1.40pm then intermittently read, marked supervision work and prepared tomorrow's workshop until 5.30pm. Finished day making notes on a research plan up until 7pm. Bit distracted. Dinner with friends and back home at 9.30pm. *Wednesday 15th Feb.* Long and varied again! Arrived at work at 9am. Meeting with all supervisors at 10am to discuss paper manuscript. Made notes on proposed changes until 11.40am. Marking student work from 11.40am to 1pm reading for supervisions today and Friday. *Long* lunch from 1 to 2.45pm, eating outside in the warm sun! Admin until 3.15pm, then paper edits until 4pm supervision with students. Finished at 5.30pm and went to exercise, then saw friends until midnight.  *Tuesday 14th Feb. (Felt like a) Long and varied day! Arrived at work at 8.10am. Supervisor meeting at 8.40am where we discussed new projects. Small tasks then continued with reviewer comments until lunch. Went out with a friend for noodles. Walked back to work in the sunshine, arriving at 1.30pm. Reviewer comments then met supervisor at 2.30pm to talk about possible research placements. Kept going on reviewer comments until 4.30pm, then small tasks until 5pm. Finally meeting about organising a workshop from 5.30 to 6pm. Left to go for a walk and then out dancing which was better than expected!  *Monday 13th Feb.* Very sunny and clear. First flowers popping up in St. James' Park! Cycled to work arriving at 8.20am then dithered until 9am. Started reading up for a meeting with a researcher at 2pm. Lunch with friends then the meeting which was fascinating. Wrote up notes on the meeting until 4.30pm then call with researcher leading new project on air pollution. Good call until 5.45pm, then finished writing notes on the first meeting until 6.40pm. Left for home.   *Sunday 12th Feb.* Up early to go and exercise with friends. Went to a cafe in Camberwell afterwards and worked on reviewer comments with much more success. Lunch on Camberwell Green and then back to cafe to read some general articles, do small tasks, and then start to process and analyse some new data for a new research project starting soon. Back home at 2pm then half an hour of small tasks before finishing at 5pm.   *Saturday 11th Feb.* Very idle day. No work, read my book. *Friday 10th Feb.* Got to work at 8am. Did small tasks for most of the morning, before working on reviewer comments from 11am to 2pm. Carried on with these edits intermittently and weakly after a sunny late lunch, too distracted to make much progress. Read some papers instead. Left at 6pm to go to a museum.*Thursday 9th Feb. London.* Started work at 9.30am after a lie in. Catching up on admin and loose tasks until lunchtime, before going out into the sunshine to buy lunch. Heard all about my friend's new shed at lunch - I am desperately jealous. Half-hearted attempt at reading about and then coding up some new methods after lunch. Must be more focussed - it is often very tricky to reimplement someone's code. Must make sure I make it as easy as possible for others. Left at 5.30pm to go out for a lovely evening. *Wednesday 8th Feb. Cambridge.* Catch up meeting with MSci student from 8.15am to 9am to check on his progress. Reading papers and preparing for first year assessment until 10.45am. Got on the train to Cambridge from KX at 10.45am, arriving in sunny Cambridge just before noon. It's always sunny coming back to university. Saw a good friend by chance at the station, before buying a quick lunch and eating on the walk to the Department. Settled into the library to prepare for the assessment at 3.30pm. Took 20 minutes to watch Zelensky speak in Westminster Hall. Assessment from 3.30pm to 4.30pm - examiners were very kind, but defending and discussing your work for an hour with two brilliant examiners is draining. Will need a big rest after (3 hour?) PhD viva! Dropped into the office briefly before heading home. *Tuesday 7th Feb.* Supervisor meeting at 9am. Reading papers until 12pm in preparation for my first year assessment tomorrow. Quick lunch and then more reading until 4pm. Back to paper writing from 4 to 5.30pm. Brief meeting from 5.30pm to 6pm re a workshop on probabilistic methods in weather and climate that we are organising in May. Cooked supper while discussing a possible research project with my old MSci supervisor - very exciting! After supper, back to paper writing from 8.45pm to 9.45pm before sending a draft to my supervisors. Finished off the evening by organising upcoming supervisions with undergrads. *Monday 6th Feb.* Started work at 9am. Emails and admin until 10.30am. Writing a draft of a paper until lunchtime - mostly tidying plots and improving explanations. More paper writing until 3pm, then a meeting with a prospective PhD student. At 3.30pm went for a walk to buy a present, before returning to write until 5.45pm. Out for a lovely evening! *Sunday 5th February, 2023. London.* A lovely day. Read for most of the day, then spent the afternoon and evening reviewing a paper. Early night!)-->
